    "character_name": "brimstone",
    "lore": "Coming from the USA, Brimstone is a tech user and veteran soldier that has seen all kinds of battles, never leaving a wounded companion behind. He was the first to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL alongside Viper, and is currently its leader. Brimstone has a very stubborn personality, acting as a 'father figure' for the group. Named the 'Old Dog' due to his age, he is treated as a leader and titled 'Commander' and 'Captain' by the other Agents. He is in charge, in some part, of picking and hiring new Agents to VP. Unlike Viper, Brimstone has a positive attitude regarding the youth in the team and hiring new members. Alongside a bottle of scotch and an incendiary grenade, Brimstone uses technology to dominate the battlefield. He has access to an array of satellite-based abilities that allow him to deploy large smoke clouds and launch orbital laser attacks through a bracer on his left arm. His bracer was designed by Killjoy. Brimstone's status as the eldest member of the PROTOCOL makes him a common target for jokes about his age, but most of them are turned down because of his sheer skill. He also seems to face considerable difficulty with handling technology and devices, oftentimes getting locked out of his bracer simply because he forgot the password. Interestingly, because his age is likely around 45-50, and the year in which the game takes place is around 2050 (this year has been retconned and the year Valorant takes place in is unknown), Brimstone is likely a millennial or younger, born at the latest in the late 90s. This would mean that he probably grew up with devices and the internet, which generates some confusion as to the cause of his difficulty with technology. Brimstone does have his own office, located under the Range. It contains several images (some of which include a childhood friend posing with him). The office also contains his phone and laptop, which can be interacted with to reveal a voicemail or email sent to him by one of the Agents. These messages are periodically updated every patch. For an archive of these, along with a more detailed description of his office, see its page.",
    "past": "Brimstone is implied to have been born in Baltimore, and has a long history of service. He was first a firefighter in the Baltimore Fire Department (Engine 8), and later moved on to the military, where he is implied to have led a group called the 'Ragged Ravens'. Throughout these parts of his life, a prominent figure is his childhood friend - they served together as firefighters and in the military, and the No One Left Behind Playercard shows Brimstone carrying his body over a battlefield. While the identity of this friend mostly remains a mystery, his name is implied to be 'Tariq Porter', through a reference in his dossier. The close ties that Brimstone has with this friend, along with the strong relationship that KAY/O has with Brimstone, has led some people to theorize that KAY/O is himself that friend of Brim's, having been replaced into a robot's body sometime in the future. The Devs have neither confirmed nor denied this theory. Several factors of his character (such as the fact that his bracer is able to access Kingdom's mainframe, all the Kingdom representation on Brimstone's suit, and his dialogue with Breach) suggest that he has been a part of the corporation at some point in the past. Later, it was revealed that he was once a commander at K-SEC, Kingdom's private militarized security division. Although it is unclear how or why he left the Corporation, it is certain that Brimstone no longer holds any position in Kingdom. Once an Agent joins the VALORANT PROTOCOL, they cease their past lives and activities, working solely for the VP - Brimstone, regardless of his role as its leader, is not exempt from these rules.",
    "appearance": "Brimstone wears an orange army beret with a patch that depicts two 'V' symbols, one inside the other. He wears Military Attire that is likely the standardized K-SEC Uniform. His metal breastplate is stamped with the number 01, referring to him being the first Agent to join the PROTOCOL. The left strap for the armor features a plate with the Kingdom Logo, which is also present on his right hand's glove. His left shoulder plate is stamped with the VALORANT PROTOCOL logo. The backplate of his armor allows for his Stim Beacon to attach in an easy-to-reach position. On his left hand is his Bracer, a metal device which displays an orange screen, used to control his Sky Smokes and Orbital Strike. When activated, the screen generates an orange holographic map. In the WARM UP cinematic, we see Brimstone with his rolled-up sleeves looser than normal, allowing us a view of a tattoo he has on his upper right arm. The pattern of the tattoo is similar to that of the Peacekeeper Sheriff, which is obtainable in-game by completing Brimstone's contract.",
